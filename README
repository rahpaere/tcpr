The TCPR home page, <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~burgess/tcpr/>, provides
information about the people involved in the project, the code development
repository, and TCPR's design and ongoing research.  This document aims
to guide someone new to the project from first cloning the code repository
through conducting a live demonstration and developing new applications.

TCPR uses the GNU autotools build system.  However, the repository does
not contain any generated files, so once, right after cloning, you must
set up some infrastructure:

  $ autoreconf -i

Then, you can build the userspace programs and iptables extension library.

  $ mkdir ../tcpr-build
  $ cd ../tcpr-build
  $ ../tcpr/configure
  $ make
  # make install

The kernel module must be built separately, using the kernel build system.

  $ cd module
  $ make
  # make install

Once the module is installed, load it into the kernel.

  # modprobe tcpr

The scripts in the `examples' directory provide a simple demonstration
of TCPR.  Start with `examplesrecovery, which demonstrate simple failure
and recovery.  First, inspect the setup scripts, then set up the network
and TCPR to prove some infrastructure for running the example application
and peer in their own lightweight virtual network, with the host acting
as ethernet bridge and filtering all TCP traffic through TCPR.  Then,
in one terminal run the `application' script, and in another run the
`peer'.  Type messages to chat back and forth.  Kill the application
with control-c, and recover it with the `recover' script.  Finally,
end the connection gracefully with control-d at each endpoint, and tear
down the network and TCPR to release the infrastructure.  The scripts
and the source code for the `tcpr-chat' program constitute a working
guide to setting up and using TCPR.

Later, explore `examples/migrate', which demonstrate live migration
based on an OpenFlow switch to migrate the underlying IP channel.
You must have Open vSwitch installed.  As in the recover scripts, start
with `application' and `peer' in separate terminals.  Then, in a third
terminal, run `migrate 1 2' to take over the application on a second
replica.  Go back to the first and run `migrate 2 1' to bring it back.
End the connection as before.
